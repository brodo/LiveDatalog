### Scalar

A ground, non-structural Datalog value. Scalars include atoms and supported
numeric values. LiveDatalog supports exact signed 64-bit integers and finite
`f64` floating-point values; NaN reports `NumericType` and infinities report
`NumericOverflow` (see `docs/adr/0001-finite-f64-scalars.md`).

Bare signed decimal integer literals denote canonical integer values. Quoted
numeric text remains an atom. Bare decimal or exponent-shaped literals denote
finite `f64` values rounded to nearest; literals beyond the finite range
return `NumericOverflow`, and malformed numeric-leading bare tokens return
`InvalidSyntax`. Bare integer-shaped literals outside the signed 64-bit range
return `NumericOverflow`.

Scalar identity is numeric across integer and floating-point representations.
A finite floating-point scalar that exactly represents an in-range integer
canonicalizes to that integer scalar at intern time, so facts, unification,
equality, and aggregation treat values such as `1` and `1.0` identically.
Floats format deterministically with shortest round-trip digits and reparse
to the same canonical scalar.

Mixed integer and floating-point comparisons are exact and do not first coerce
the integer to `f64`. Mixed arithmetic produces a floating-point result, then
canonicalizes an exact in-range integral result back to an integer scalar.

Canonical ground values have a deterministic total order: numbers in numeric
order, atoms in lexical byte order, `nil`, then cons values lexicographically
by head and tail. The total order reports equality exactly when scalar identity
is equal.
